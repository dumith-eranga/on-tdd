# Pride is good

In a previous article I talked about why laziness is a virtue. However, I mentioned that, in order to complete the picture, you need another attribute.
This time, let's see how we can complete the picture.

Most of the time we use the word *pride* as a synonym for arrogance. That is why we have this notion of negativity and try to be careful not to bring up this word when we are in a conversation. We almost never say things like "I'm a very proud guy". The only exception is that when we offer a complement, saying something like, "I'm really proud of you". So, based on this pattern of thinking, you can claim to be proud of someone, but never of yourself, at least not publicly. To me, this doesn't make any sense.

Let take a moment to (re)define pride.
Pride is the self worth you attribute to yourself after adding value to some cause.

It could be something as simple as helping your neighbour with the grocery bags or helping your kid with her homework. On the other hand, it could be something as big as developing a vaccination for a strain of influenza or finding a solution to global warming.

It is very easy for us to see the increment of our self worth if we had done the big, but very hard to see it for the simpler ones. The problem with that is, the big ones take so much time and effort. They could even take a few generations to add the value to the cause. And most often we can't contribute to more than a very few in our lifetime (unless you are an Einstein). The simpler ones on the other hand are abundant, and we do them anyway.

But there is a catch.
You can't be honest and proud unless you know that you did that thing to the best of your ability at the given time.

So, how do we know what is our best?
You will know it when you can't answer your own question - "what else can I do?". That is when you have explored all your options, made your best judgements and put in your best effort.

Having said that, I must warn you against looking back and trying to evaluate whether you did a good job. Hindsight is 20/20, and more often than not, we see that we could have taken better courses of action when we look back. This is based on our current level of understanding and the information we have now - not what we had or knew at that moment in the past.
