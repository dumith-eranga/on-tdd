# Motivation we seek is a lie 

What does motivation mean to you?

Almost every time I get a CV or the cover letter from an applicant for a job, it has this word in one form or another. One may say like _"I'm a highly motivated software engineer, who ...."_. Another may say like _"I have taken the initiatives to do ... and ... at my workplace as a result of which ..."_. All these synonyms and fancy ways of writing, at the end of the day, is talking about motivation.

On the flip-side when we advertise vacancies, including my organization, we too mention this word - in one form or another. They may go like _"we are looking for innovative ..."_, _"The perfect candidate will be self-motivated, ...."_ or like _"an individual who has a flair for ..."_. No matter how we say it, it is the same thing we are looking for.

Our employers want us to be motivated to do more work. The government wants us to be motivated to contribute more to economic growth (and pay our taxes on time). The schools want us to be motivated students. And heck, even our parents want us to be more motivated to either earn more (if you are working) or learn more (if you are studying). We are surrounded by the need to be motivated.

To cater to that ever growing need, we are constantly seeking motivation. Sometimes we find motivation in reaching the end goal or in winning the grand prize. Other times we find the motivation in the form of fun we have when we are doing something. At times, the motivator is money. At some other times, peer-pressure is the motivator.

And then, we have all these motivational activities and training programs that people go through. We have a lot of motivational speakers who tell us how to be motivated and teach us various tips, tricks and techniques.

So what really is this motivation that we seek?

**Motivation is a mental state that you achieve when you have a need, want or an urge to do something.**

There are days that you are highly motivated and there are days your motivation has run out. In the former case, everything is good and smooth. In the latter, either we seek motivation by external stimulants - from coffee to drugs to some other things - or we shut-down, hoping for a better day tomorrow.

For years, I believed that this common sense is the way it is. We all have gone through the ups and downs and seen others doing the same. However, I recently heard something that shattered my belief.

    Motivation is whatever that gets you moving.

In his interview titled [Motivation for Creative People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuuF2f_VvMQ), when Mark McGuinness mentioned this idea, it really made me realize the lie I had been living in.

We do not need to look for motivation or something to motivate us. What we really need to do is pick something, anything, that gets us moving. And the size or the sophistication does not matter. The only attribute we need to check is whether it gets us moving. Write, scribble, draw a doodle, jump up and down, do a hand-stand, take a shower, eat a burger - do whatever, as long as it gets you moving. Before you notice it, one thing leads to another and another until you get moving in the direction you want at the speed you want.

This simple idea has started to make a tremendous impact on my life.

Let me prove it. The text you read is a result of that impact. I have been thinking of writing for a long time. I have considered topics, collected and curated information, analyzed interests and read a lot of books, blogs and articles - looking for that one thing, motivation, to get me started. And here I am, who sat down to write one paragraph of text (so that I keep moving) before I go to bed at the end of a very long and tiring work-day.

So, what gets you moving?
