# Why should you be lazy

We all love hard-working people, be it when you are interviewing to hire new people to expand your business organization or when you are buying a service from a service provider or a merchant. That has been the norm and the common sense - the harder you work, the more valuable you are to the client or the employer.

So it may look like very counter-intuitive when I say that you should be lazy. Though I cannot make this statement about all the industries of the world, I can speak from experience, about my industry - Information Technology. Here, you have to be lazy to get ahead.

Why is it that laziness is rewarded?

Let's take a step back and try to see the bigger picture. Every technological advancement was a result of an attempt to be lazy, be it good or bad.

Wheel was invented so that you can be lazy when you transport goods. Bicycle was invented so that you can be lazy when you are travelling. Nuclear bomb was invented so that you can be lazy when you are going to decimate the enemy. e-commerce was invented so that you can be lazy when you are shopping. The list goes on and on.

As evident through out the history, the need to be lazy drives innovation. And in my industry, innovation is what brings in the most value. The more value you bring in, the ahead you can get.

There is a popular quote attributed to Bill Gates that indicate how valuable laziness is.

    I will always choose a lazy person to do a difficult job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.

However, being lazy is only a half of the picture. You need something additional to complete the picture.

Do you know what it is?
