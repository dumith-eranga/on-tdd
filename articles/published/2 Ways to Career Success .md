# 2 Ways to Career Success 

Meet John who works at company X. He is very valuable to his organization. He has been at the company for along - almost from the beginning of the project. He is very capable and knows every nook and cranny of his project. Since this project is the bread and butter of the company, John is highly respected and has had an excellent career.

He is a very highly skilled programmer. He can write very clever code, at almost inhuman speed, and do miracles when he sits down in front of the computer. He is the go-to guy when you have a problem and needs a quick coding solution or when you need expert advice about something related to his project.

John is fully committed and dedicated to his project. He relentlessly pushes himself towards technical excellence and takes his team and the company along the way with him.

The company wants to keep John with them because he is an integral part of their survival and growth.


Meet Jim who works at company Y. He is very valuable to his organization. He joined the company recently and started working on a project that has been there for long. He was brought in to fill some technical skill gaps that the team had. Since this project is the bread and butter of the company, Jim's work is having a big impact on the business.

Jim is not the greatest programmer you would see. He, however, can look at a problem objectively and try out many potential solutions until one thing gives the results he is after. He is willing to make mistakes, admit the fact and try again; despite the chance of failure. He always has a suggestion to try-out to whatever the question someone asks him.

Jim implement workflows and bring techniques into the team so that the team can achieve almost anything. Though Jim's work is increasingly fading into the background as the skill of the team grows, the company recognizes the value Jim brings in.

The company wants to keep Jim with them because he makes improvements to the way they work which leads to more and improved business.


Our two heroes are the two stereotypes that I have seen having successful careers in the Software Engineering industry. Each has different environments that they can thrive in.
