# Be Willing to be Misunderstood

I came across this interview by Jeff Bezos a couple of days ago. He talks about the Amazon culture and outline some of the guiding principles they are following like being customer focused (as opposed to competitor focus) and eagerness to invent. He also mentions about the early days of Amazon.com and his childhood memories as examples of certain attributes he talks about.

Among all the nuggets of wisdom he shared, one thing in particular caught my mind. It is so simple, so obvious and yet so much profound.

    If you are going to do anything new or innovative, you have to be willing to be misunderstood.

And he went on to add, "And if you can't tolerate that, for god's sake, don't do anything new or innovative."

He brings in evidence for this from one of his past experiences. During the era when Amazon.com was only a book seller, they have introduced a new feature to allow people to review the books on sale. One concern that many publishers had was that not all reviews were positive. In fact, some have suggested that Amazon should only display the positive reviews.

Looking back, the idea of publishing only the positive reviews looks quite insane now. If it happened, nobody would have trusted the reviews.

His quote resonated very well with some of the experiences I had (and will continue to have in future) on my own. Not all things we do, will be understood by people around us.

Since I make my living by creating software to address business problems in innovative ways, I find such misunderstandings very counter-productive, for both the business and personal growth.

What would you do when you are misunderstood?
