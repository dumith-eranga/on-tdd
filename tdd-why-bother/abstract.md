# Abstract

We all have heard good things about Test Driven Development. TDD, as it is commonly called, is recommended as a good practice for software development. Though it is quite popular internationally, we do not see enough buy-in locally.

This session will introduce the concept of TDD, discuss some reasons for its low adoption, the wrong reasons to practice it, and some side effects or concerns of adopting it. The session will try to focus more on some aspects that are usually not discussed under this topic. Most importantly, this webinar will show you some personal reasons why you should practice TDD.
