## Evolution

1. No Test Development
2. Test-Last Development (TLD)
3. Test-First Development (TFD)
4. Test-Drivern Development (TDD)
---

## TFD

1. Write a test
2. Write production code until all tests are passing

1. Write a test
2. Write production code until all tests are passing
3. Refactor until happy with code structure

# The 3 Rules of TDD
_Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob)_

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
1. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
1. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

- Incremental & iterative Development
- Change / refactoring with confidence
- Emergent design
- Forces developers to think
- Helps to clarify requirements
- Faster / smaller feedback loop
- Documents your code better

## Professions *have* Practices  

##### Healthcare is a _profession_
##### Accounting is a _profession_

<!--
    Is programming a profession?

    Why Healthcare / Accounting?
        - a high risk profession.

    Practices:
        - A doctor washing hands before a surgery.
        - Double entry book keeping.
